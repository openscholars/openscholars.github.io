# Open Scholars Project

## About

The Open Scholars Project is an informal forum to learn about and discuss developments in open access. The group will allow FSU researchers and scholars to share experiences with open publishing, code and data across subject areas. We aim to create a group that is also action-oriented and supportive in bringing faculty, post-docs and graduate students together. The group meets monthly each semester.
